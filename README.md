# Football-Events-Project

Summer project taking a look at a popular football dataset found on Kaggle.com posted by Alin Secareanu (https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events/data).

The dataset contains three files: events, ginf, and dictionary. The events file will be most important for my work since this gives a detailed breakdown of individual events occuring in football matches from the top divisions of England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France between 2011-2017. Specifically, the data contains information about 9,074 games and yields 941,009 events in those games. The ginf file contains metadata and market odds for each game and the dictionary contains references for variables used in the events data which describe the nature of an event.

Before any analysis, I attempted to improve the data by including the league of the match in which an event took place, and the season, so that these can be used to subset or look at season averages, etc.

I will start with some exploratory analysis of the data, attemping to understand some basic patterns in the variables in the dataset. Then, I will place myself in the position of an analyst at a club which does not score many goals and attempt to explain why they do not score many and give suggestions as to what they should be doing differently.
